# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients, specifically unexpected rendering or failure to apply a gradient background.  This might be due to version incompatibility, conflicting styles, or simple typos.

## Bug Description

The code uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a gradient background, but the gradient may not render correctly or might not appear at all.  The issue might be related to:

*   **Tailwind CSS version:**  Older versions might use different syntax for gradients.
*   **Conflicting CSS:** Other CSS rules could override Tailwind styles.
*   **Typos:** Minor typos in class names can prevent styles from being applied.

## Reproduction Steps

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies (if any are required).
3.  Run the application.
4.  Observe the unexpected rendering of the gradient background.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for:

*   **Correct Tailwind CSS version:** Use the latest version or check your version's documentation.
*   **Conflicting styles:** Inspect the browser's developer tools for any conflicting CSS rules.
*   **Typos:** Double-check all class names for accuracy.
